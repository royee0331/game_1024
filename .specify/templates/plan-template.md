# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5+ (engine + UI)
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite, React 18+, `packages/core` engine library
**Storage**: None (in-memory board state only)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (interaction), Storybook (visual regression)
**Target Platform**: Desktop browsers (Chromium reference, touch-friendly fallback)
**Project Type**: Web application with shared packages
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS render loop, <80ms p95 input-to-animation latency
**Constraints**: Pure engine functions, seeded RNG, accessibility & telemetry hooks mandatory
**Scale/Scope**: Single-player board sessions with replay export support

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Core engine work is confined to `packages/core` and expressed as pure functions with no
  timers, DOM access, or implicit globals.
- Plans specify how RNG seeds are injected, recorded, and exposed for the feature.
- Test strategy lists required Vitest, Playwright, and Storybook coverage before coding.
- Performance budget (16ms frame, <80ms latency) is addressed with mitigation steps if at
  risk.
- Accessibility controls, telemetry payloads, and logging fields for the feature are
  identified and mapped to implementation tasks.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
