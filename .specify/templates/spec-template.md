# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

  For Game 1024, each story MUST document:
  - The starting board matrix and RNG seed
  - The sequence of player inputs
  - The expected emitted engine events and resulting board
  - Telemetry or accessibility impact introduced by the story
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - include RNG seed, fixture reference, and which Vitest/Playwright specs validate it]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** board state `[fixture-id]` with RNG seed `[seed]`, **When** the player swipes `[direction]`, **Then** tiles merge into `[expected matrix]` and score changes by `[delta]`.
2. **Given** telemetry is enabled, **When** the move completes, **Then** an event `[event-name]` containing board hash `[hash]` and latency `[metric]` is emitted.

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->
- Simultaneous triple merges when tiles chain in `[direction]`
- No-move detection when the board is full and RNG still attempts to spawn tiles
- Replaying a saved seed after undo/redo operations
- Accessibility regression checks (screen reader labels, high contrast mode)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Engine MUST expose `applyMove(state, input, rng)` returning `{state, events}` with no side effects.
- **FR-002**: UI MUST dispatch player inputs to the engine within 8ms and animate resulting events within 16ms frames.
- **FR-003**: Session controller MUST persist RNG seed and move history for replay/undo.
- **FR-004**: Telemetry module MUST emit structured move events containing board hash, score delta, duration, and seed.
- **FR-005**: Accessibility layer MUST provide focus management, ARIA labels for tiles, and keyboard shortcuts for all actions.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Replay export MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file format not specified - JSON? binary?]
- **FR-007**: Visual theme switcher MUST meet [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: contrast ratio requirements pending]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **GameState**: Immutable representation of tiles, score, move count, and RNG cursor.
- **EngineEvent**: Discrete outputs (`SpawnTile`, `MergeTiles`, `MoveRejected`, `GameOver`) produced by the engine.
- **TelemetryEnvelope**: Payload describing move metadata, board hash, accessibility flags, and performance timings.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of moves complete with <80ms input-to-animation latency in Playwright benchmarks.
- **SC-002**: 100% of deterministic replay fixtures reproduce identical board states when seeded.
- **SC-003**: Accessibility audits (axe-core) report zero critical issues for the new feature.
- **SC-004**: Telemetry coverage confirms â‰¥99% of moves emit the expected structured payload.
