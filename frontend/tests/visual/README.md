# Visual Baselines

The JSON manifests in this directory describe the Storybook stories and
viewports captured for mobile responsiveness.

- `mobile-controls.baseline.json` covers the `MobileControls` component in
  portrait (360×640) and landscape (640×360) configurations. Visual tooling
  can load these entries to drive screenshot updates when stories change.
